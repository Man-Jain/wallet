 * (RETRY_COOLDOWN_SEC · 2^(n-1), capped at MAX_RETRY_BACKOFF_SEC) so a deterministic
 * failure decays to a daily probe instead of an endless drip (#215, #313).
 *

 * the isBeingClaimed gate (e.g. two Explore re-renders racing the NoteClaimStarted
 * intercom round-trip) both see `[]` from the check and both `.add()`, producing two
 * queued consume rows — the second of which fails on-chain with "note has already been
 * consumed" and spuriously trips the connectivity-issue banner.
 *
 * Returns the queued batch row id, or — when every note was deduped away — the
 * id of the row that blocked the most recent note (live/Completed dedup winner
 * or the most recent Failed row from the backoff gate), so callers always get
 * a stable "this note already has a tx" response.

/**
 * Bounded-retry policy for auto-consume.
 *
 * Background: the consume dedup at `initiateConsumeTransaction` excludes
 * `Failed` rows by design so retries can recover from *transient* failures
 * (e.g., kernel `auth::request` errors that clear once chain state
 * advances). But without a brake, an upstream deterministic failure
 * combined with auto-consume's polling cadence + tab-switch remounts
 * produces an unbounded retry storm — one user empirically observed 122+
 * consume/Failed rows for 2 notes in 38 minutes (#215).
 *
 * The original #215 fix was a sliding *window* throttle (cap N failures per
 * 30 min, then one attempt per 5 min). That bounds the *rate* but never the
 * *lifetime*: old failures age out of the window, so a note that
 * `getConsumableNotes` keeps offering yet that fails on-chain every time (a
 * deterministic rejection the consumability annotation misses, a `mock`
 * network, an "already consumed" race) drips one failure every 5 min
 * forever — 49 failures over 4 days in the captured profile (#313).
 *
 * Policy (terminal-safe exponential backoff):
 *   - n = the note+account's LIFETIME Failed rows.
 *   - Require RETRY_COOLDOWN_SEC · 2^(n-1) of idle since the most recent
 *     Failed `completedAt` before allowing another attempt, capped at
 *     MAX_RETRY_BACKOFF_SEC.
 *
 * The interval therefore grows without bound (5 min → 10 → 20 → … → 24 h),
 * so the storm decays to at most a daily probe. It stays a *probe*, not a
 * permanent give-up: a note that later becomes consumable (its reclaim
 * height is reached, chain state advances) is retried at the next expiry and
 * recovers on its own — no failure-class parsing, no stuck-forever state. A
 * transient failure that clears early still retries promptly because a
 * Completed row reactivates the existing-non-Failed dedup branch, and an
 * explicit user Retry (`manualRetry`) bypasses the backoff entirely.
