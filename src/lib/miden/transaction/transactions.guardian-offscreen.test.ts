/**
 * Guardian write LEAF PIPELINE → offscreen routing (issue #260, slices 6a + 6b + 7c).
 *
 * These tests exercise `generateTransaction` at the routing seam: with the
 * offscreen client flag OFF the routable guardian leaf runs inline
 * (`runGuardianPipeline` → the mocked SW client's execute→prove→submit→apply);
 * with it ON the SAME leaf crosses to `dispatchGuardianPipeline`. Everything
 * around the leaf — proposal creation, cold co-sign, mid-flight `persistNewHotKey`,
 * `signAndCreateTransactionRequest`, and the `abandonCandidate` submit-catch — stays
 * SW-side and is asserted unchanged. The structural `waitForTransactionCommit` now
 * routes through `midenClientProxy.waitForTransactionCommit` (issue #260, slice 6b
 * bug fix) so it polls the SAME client that applied the tx — the offscreen realm
 * flag-on, the SW client flag-off — instead of always poking the raw SW client
 * (which flag-on is dormant, timing the wait out and stranding the completion).
 *
 * Slice 6a covers the four VALUE-MOVING types (send / consume / swap / execute);
 * slice 6b adds the three STRUCTURAL types (switch-guardian / replace-hot-key /
 * update-procedure-threshold), which additionally exercise: the cold co-sign +
 * `persistNewHotKey` running SW-side BEFORE dispatch (byte-identical order flag-on
 * vs flag-off), the proxy-routed `waitForTransactionCommit` running AFTER with the
 * re-derived tx id, and the structural apply-after-submit classifier (reconcile for
 * replace-hot-key / switch-guardian; Fail for update-procedure-threshold).
 *
 * Coverage:
 *   - §4.0 round-trip: the co-signed request crosses to the offscreen leaf as the
 *     EXACT `tr.serialize()` bytes (advice map — carrying the co-signatures —
 *     intact; the byte-level serialize→transport→deserialize→execute round-trip is
 *     proven in miden-client-proxy.test.ts + offscreen/main.test.ts).
 *   - flag routing OFF/ON per value-moving AND structural type; slice 7c adds the last
 *     two value-moving types (bridged-send / earn-deposit), which now route offscreen
 *     like send/swap — with the errorCode classifier marking them Failed (not Completed)
 *     on a post-submit apply failure, byte-identical to their flag-OFF inline throw.
 *   - flag-off/flag-on byte-identity: the completion handler receives a result with
 *     identical `serialize()` bytes on both paths.
 *   - persistNewHotKey ordering parity: replace-hot-key persists the new hot key
 *     SW-side, exactly once, with identical args and BEFORE the leaf, on both flags.
 *   - waitForTransactionCommit: for structural types it routes through the proxy
 *     AFTER the leaf with the id re-derived from `result.executedTransaction().id()`,
 *     on both flags — never the raw SW `getMidenClient().waitForTransactionCommit`.
 *   - kill-window (funds-safety): an offscreen `OperationAbortedError` (wedge-kill)
 *     runs `abandonCandidate` exactly once (as inline) and marks the row FAILED —
 *     it is NOT auto-requeued, and it dispatches exactly ONCE. A guardian
 *     send/swap/execute has NO input-note nullifier (each retry builds a FRESH
 *     proposal with a new random output-note serial), so auto-requeueing would let
 *     the retry build a second valid send and DOUBLE-SEND; a structural op is
 *     nonce-gated and excluded from REQUEUEABLE_TYPES (never auto-requeued), so its
 *     only recovery is a user re-run against post-change chain state — never a
 *     double-apply. Falling through to Failed matches slices 5a/5b and flag-OFF.
 *   - errorCode: a round-tripped `ApplyTransactionAfterSubmitFailed` reaches the
 *     GUARDIAN classifier → value-moving marks Completed (mirrors the fixed
 *     non-guardian bug); structural replace-hot-key / switch-guardian route to the
 *     reconcile handler, update-procedure-threshold to Failed.
