/**
 * Whether a private note's body has reached the transport layer.

 * private note reachable at all — the chain carries a commitment, not the note. A
 * send can be legitimately Completed (the assets have left the account, so Failed
 * would be untrue and would offer a Retry that spends again) while its note
 * reached nobody.
 *
 * Absent means the question does not apply or predates this field: a public send
 * needs no relay, and rows written by an older build never recorded one.
 *
 *   - `pending`     — a relay is OWED. Written BEFORE the relay is attempted,
 *                     together with the evidence needed to reason about it later,
 *                     so an interruption mid-relay leaves a record rather than
 *                     nothing. This is the state the wallet previously had no way
 *                     to represent, which is why an interrupted relay was
 *                     indistinguishable from a successful one.
 *   - `relayed`     — the transport is believed to HOLD the note: either it accepted
 *                     the push, or it rejected a re-push as a duplicate, which is
 *                     itself evidence the body is already there. Deliberately not
 *                     terminal, for two separate reasons. An empty
 *                     `SendNoteResponse` means acceptance is not proof of storage, so
 *                     the row stays eligible for the re-push sweep, which tests
 *                     exactly that. And even a genuinely stored note can be
 *                     unreachable: the recipient's opaque pagination cursor never
 *                     goes back, so one that advanced past the note leaves it
 *                     invisible forever (note-transport-service#77) — a case NO
 *                     re-push can repair (see `note-delivery-sweep.ts`) and only the
 *                     nullifier can settle. `relayed` therefore means "believed to be
 *                     in flight", never "delivered".
 *   - `confirmed`   — the note was CONSUMED on chain. This is the only positive
 *                     proof of delivery available: the recipient cannot consume a
 *                     private note without having received its body, so the
 *                     nullifier is the receipt. Terminal.
 *   - `undelivered` — the relay was attempted and did not succeed. Not necessarily
 *                     permanent (the SDK's own outbox may still retry it, and that
 *                     retry replays the ORIGINAL block hint, so it stays correct
 *                     however late it runs) — but it may equally mean nothing was

   *
   * `mayHaveSubmitted` records a crossing that HAPPENED. This records that we
   * do not yet know whether one will: the cancel marks the row but does not
   * abort the work, so the pipeline runs on and may still submit. The GUARDIAN
   * leaves stamp `mayHaveSubmitted` before submitting and their writes go through
   * a terminal row, so a crossing that occurs there IS recorded — but only from
   * the moment the leaf reaches it. Between the cancel and that stamp the row
   * looks pre-submit, and a retry in that window would rebuild the request and pay
   * twice. This field covers exactly that gap.
   *
   * For a send from a non-guardian account there is no such stamp to supplement:
   * that leaf calls through to the proxy without recording anything, and the row
   * stays at the 'sending' its pipeline set once at pickup. This field is then the
   * only evidence that exists, which is why the retry guard refuses on it outright
   * rather than merely declining to rebuild.
   *
   * It has to expire, which is why it is a timestamp rather than a boolean. The
   * first version of this guard was a sticky flag, and a sticky "maybe" is
   * indistinguishable from "yes" forever: a send that failed while proving got
   * its bytes pinned permanently, so every retry replayed the identical bad
   * request instead of rebuilding it — defeating the callback-asset fix this
   * whole change exists for, and freezing an absolute reclaim height that a
   * later attempt could land already past. So:
   *
   *   - the pipeline's own catch CLEARS it, because reaching that catch proves
   *     the pipeline stopped; if it had submitted, the leaf already stamped
   *     `mayHaveSubmitted` and the guard holds on that instead;
   *   - failing that, it lapses after `MAX_WAIT_BEFORE_CANCEL`, the app's own
   *     definition of the longest a pipeline can plausibly still be alive.
   *
   * Both the Cancel button and the stuck reaper set it. The reaper used to be
   * excluded, on the reasoning that a row it takes has already exceeded that same
   * maximum and so cannot still be running — but the threshold is when the app
   * stops waiting, not when the work stops: nothing aborts the pipeline, a mobile
   * write has no deadline at all, and the maximum is counted in ACTIVE seconds, so
   * a reaped row can still be mid-submit. That made the reaper the widest instance
   * of the window this field exists to cover.
